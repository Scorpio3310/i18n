title: getLocalePlaceholder
---

Allows you to get the current locale inside of `getStaticPaths`. It's a build time macro.
That means it will be replaced by it's literal value. For instance:

```astro
---
import { getLocalePlaceholder } from "i18n:astro"

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
    const locale = getLocalePlaceholder()

    return []
}
---
```

Will be replaced by the following, no matter the context:

```astro {5}
---
import { getLocalePlaceholder } from "i18n:astro"

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
    const locale = "en"

    return []
}
---
```

Be careful not to use `getLocalePlaceholder` in interpolations or it could result in invalid code.
