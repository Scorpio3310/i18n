title: getLocalePath
---

Allows you get the right url for the current locale. It's strictly typed and even requires you to pass parameters as needed.

:::note
`getLocalePath` does not take your `trailingSlash` configuration into account and always returns without a trailing slash.

import { getLocalePath } from "i18n:astro"

getLocalePath("/")
getLocalePath("/about")
getLocalePath("/blog/[slug]", {
    slug: "hello-world"
})
