title: Known issues

Below are the currently known issues and limitations (but they're probably more!):

1. **View transitions** has not been tested but is probably broken. That should not require too much work though
2. Using `getLocalePath` and `switchLocalePath` with **rest parameters** has not been tested but may work already
3. Using utilities **outside of the `src/routes` directory** has not been tested but probably works already
4. **Localized 404 error pages** have not been tested but may work already
5. The official **sitemap integration** works but is not optimally integrated. The alternate links won't be generated for different paths (eg. `/about`, `/fr/a-propos`)
6. Usage in **Starlight** has not been tested but is not recommended, has it has own i18n system.
