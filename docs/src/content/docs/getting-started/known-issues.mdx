title: Known issues

Below are the currently known issues and limitations (but they're probably more!):

- Using `getLocalePath` and `switchLocalePath` with **rest parameters** has not been tested but may work already
- Using utilities **outside of the `src/routes` directory** has not been tested but probably works already
- **Localized 404 error pages** have not been tested but may work already
- The official **sitemap integration** works but is not optimally integrated. The alternate links won't be generated for different paths (eg. `/about`, `/fr/a-propos`)
- Usage in **Starlight** has not been tested but is not recommended, as it has own i18n system.
